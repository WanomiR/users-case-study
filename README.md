# Users: case study
Simple REST API with Postgres and Redis.

## Instructions
- To generate swagger docs, build and start the app run:
    ```bash
    make all
    ```
- To build the app without generating docs run:
    ```bash
    make build
    ```
- Use other make commands to conduct database operations.


> [!note]  
> It is important to use `make` as it loads necessary environment variables.
